# 🏠 Housing Price Analysis & Prediction Web Application

A full-stack web application built using **Flask** that integrates **Tableau dashboards** for housing market analysis and provides a simple house price prediction feature based on user inputs.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project combines:

- 📊 Interactive Tableau Dashboard for housing sales trends  
- 📈 Data storytelling using Tableau  
- 🧮 House price prediction form (Flask backend)  
- 🔁 Proper POST → Redirect → GET (PRG) implementation  
- 🎨 Responsive UI using Bootstrap  

It demonstrates frontend-backend integration along with embedded data visualization.

---

# ⚙️ How To Run This Project Locally

⚠️ The virtual environment (`venv`) is NOT included in this repository.  
You must create your own virtual environment before running the project.

---

## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd House_Prediction
---

## 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv

This creates a new isolated Python environment.

---

## 3️⃣ Activate the Virtual Environment

### ▶ Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
---

## 4️⃣ Install Required Dependencies
pip install flask
---

## 5️⃣ Run the Application
python app.py

---

## 6️⃣ Open in Browser

Go to:
http://127.0.0.1:50000



---

# 💡 Important Notes

- Recommended Python version: **Python 3.10 or 3.11**
- Do NOT upload the `venv` folder to GitHub
- Always activate the virtual environment before running the project
- If errors occur, create a fresh virtual environment

# 📊 About the Prediction Feature

The prediction module:

1. Accepts user input via form (POST request)
2. Performs backend calculation
3. Uses PRG (Post → Redirect → Get) pattern
4. Displays result dynamically on the webpage

Currently, the prediction uses a sample calculation logic.  
It can be upgraded by integrating a trained Machine Learning model (`.pkl` file).

---

# 🔮 Future Improvements

- Integrate real ML model
- Store predictions in database
- Add user authentication
- Deploy to cloud (Render / Railway / AWS)
- Convert prediction to AJAX (no page reload)
